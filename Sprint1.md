## What issues we planned to address?
After assigning roles in Sprint 0, our main goals were to set up our respective project environments, get familiar with our respective languages/frameworks/dependencies, and create a functional account creation/login feature.

***Front-End***
- Obtain a basic understanding of Angular, HTML, CSS, and Typescript 
- Set up a basic angular project
- Create a basic login page that accepts user input
- Style the login elements with Angular Material
- Position and properly pad login elements
- Link the front and back-end
- Send requests to back-end for creating an account and logging in
- Route to a home or profile page after logging in
- Have the home/profile page as the default route and authenticate that the user has logged in

## Which issues were successfully completed?
***Front-End***<br>
We spent the majority of sprint 1 setting up our project and learning the fundamentals of Angular and the languages it makes use of (TS, HTML, CSS). We watched a lot of tutorials and read a lot of online documentation. We created a tutorial project (a to-do-list app) that helped overview fundamental Angular concepts. The to-do app makes use of JSON server as a mock back-end. Afterwards, we were able to create a basic login and register form for our app that made use of Angular Material for stylized UI components. 

## Which ones didn't and why?
***Front-End***<br>
Within our two week sprint, we were able to set up the login/register form, but we were not able to actually connect our front-end (login form) to send/receive requests to the back-end . We also did not route the user to a home/profile page after logging in, due to time constraints. The front-end members were unable to complete all issues due to spending considerable time learning Angular, TypeScript, CSS, and HTML (given no prior experience). We also ran into issues trying to set up a connection between the front and back-end.
